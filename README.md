# MyselfUi

This project has the purpose to serve as a presentation page of my own profile and will receive in the future more features. But for now it will contain one single profile page.

This is an Angular project generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.2.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build the Application

Run `npm run build` to build the project for production release. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Design

The layout is based on the free Bootstrap Theme offered by [Creative Tim](https://demos.creative-tim.com/now-ui-kit-angular/#/index) under MIT License.
